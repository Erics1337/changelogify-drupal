# Changelogify for Drupal

**Automatically collect site changes, group them into releases, and publish a public changelog.**

Changelogify captures events from your Drupal site (content changes, module installations, user events) and helps you turn them into polished release notes for clients, stakeholders, or public consumption.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Automatic Event Capture** — Logs content creates/updates/deletes, module installs, and user changes
- **Release Management** — Group events into releases with sections: Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed, Security, Other
- **Public Changelog** — Publish releases at `/changelog` with a clean, themeable UI
- **Admin Dashboard** — Quick stats and one-click release generation
- **Drupal 10/11 Compatible** — Built with modern Drupal best practices

---

## 📋 Requirements

- Drupal 10.x or 11.x
- PHP 8.1+
- Node and User modules (core)

---

## 🚀 Installation

Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. See
[Installing Drupal Modules](https://www.drupal.org/docs/extending-drupal/installing-modules)
for general guidance.

### For Existing Drupal Sites (Recommended)

Install with Composer and enable the module with Drush or the Drupal admin UI:

```bash
composer require drupal/changelogify
drush en changelogify -y
```

### For Local Development (Optional DDEV Example)

If you use DDEV, you can use the following example workflow:

```bash
# Clone and set up
git clone https://github.com/Erics1337/changelogify-drupal.git
cd changelogify-drupal

# Start DDEV and install Drupal
ddev start
ddev composer create-project "drupal/recommended-project:^10" . --no-install
ddev composer install
ddev composer require drush/drush
ddev drush site:install standard --site-name="My Site" -y

# Enable Changelogify
ddev drush en changelogify -y
ddev drush cr
```

### Manual Installation (Without Composer)

Copy the `web/modules/custom/changelogify` folder to your site's `modules/custom` directory and enable via Drush or the admin UI:

```bash
drush en changelogify -y
```
